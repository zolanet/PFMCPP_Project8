Project 8: Part 1/1
video: Chapter 4 Part 6

Purpose:  This project will teach you more about casting across class hierarchies as well as range-based for() loops, and issues that come with inheritance.

Create a branch named Part1

Public vs. Protected vs Private & Friend

Build/Run often with this task to make sure you're not breaking the code with each step.
    I recommend committing after you get each step working so you can revert to a working version easily if needed.
    it's very easy to mess this task up. 

your task: 
    0) get familiar with the classes. 

    1) Fix the include errors. 

    2) HighwayPatrol can check the speed of vehicles on the highway. 
        make this happen without adding getters to the Highway or Vehicle class

    3) implement the Highway::addVehicleInternal 
        this function should call the non-evasive member function of the derived class, so use the technique shown in the Casting video.

    4) implement the Highway::removeVehicleInternal
        this function should call the evasive member function of the derived class, if it has one. use the technique shown in the Casting video.

    5) Add a Truck type
        semi-trucks don't evade when they're pulled over, unlike cars and motorcycles.  
        They'll also need a member function that can be called when they are added to the highway.  Look at the Highway member functions for more hints on this.

    6) Add some Cars to the Highway
    7) Add some Motorcycles to the Highway
    8) Add some SemiTrucks to the highway. 

    9) clear any warnings as best you can, based on what you've learned in the previous projects
        see the note in main() about implementing the special member functions.
        This will clear a lot of warnings if implemented correctly.

     instantiating vectors like this creates unexpected copies during the construction process:
     
     std::vector<std::string> strings
     {
        std::string("a string"),
        std::string("another string)"
     };
     
     We have not learned how to properly implement copy constructors or copy assignment operators yet at this point in the course.
     These functions are part of the group of special member functions that all UDTs have.
     
     Instead we will learn about in-place construction to avoid making unexpected copies of our UDTs.
     Unexpected copies could cause Undefined Behavior (UB)
     The rule of 3-5-0 video will explain these special member functions and this UB in more detail.
     
     For now, these special member functions will be implemented using the compiler's default implementation.
     the Vehicle class shows how to do this.
     
     You must implement these special member functions for all of the classes that derive from Vehicle.

     v-table warnings can be resolved by eliminating header file implementations.
